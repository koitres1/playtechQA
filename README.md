I haven't had any prior experience with Selenium so this was a new learning experience for me. Verifying if the QA internship role was shown on the page was the 
most difficult task for me, because I was not sure how I needed to verify it. On the Playtech internship tab I didn't find anything about it and when inspecting 
the website, nothing really jumped out at me, so I let the code find by link text, as if it were shown it should link to a new tab, but it didn't find anything. 
On the Junit point I was not really sure what to test on this particual project, so I just did two tests that passed and two that failed. The rest of the points 
I did with the help of my friend Google.
